🌟 Featured Projects 🌟

💠 Continuous Monitoring and Logging with ELK Stack and Azure                             
• Developed a centralized logging solution using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) 
on Azure for real-time log aggregation, monitoring, and analysis across multiple applications and 
services. 
• Integrated Azure VMs, databases, and other services to ship logs to Elasticsearch using Logstash, 
providing comprehensive visibility into system health and performance. 
• Configured Kibana dashboards to visualize key metrics and implemented alerts for critical log events, 
ensuring rapid detection and resolution of issues. 
• Automated scaling of the ELK Stack using Terraform, enabling dynamic resource allocation based on 
workload demand. 

💠Hybrid Cloud Backup Solution Using AWS and Azure                                             
Sep 2023 – Dec 2023 
• Architected a hybrid cloud backup solution leveraging AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage for 
redundancy and disaster recovery. 
• Automated the backup and restore process using Python scripts and AWS Lambda functions to ensure 
daily snapshots of critical data. 
• Implemented lifecycle policies to automate the archiving and deletion of old data, reducing storage 
costs while maintaining compliance with retention policies. 
• Secured the environment by implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) and encryption in 
transit and at rest across both cloud providers.

💠 CI/CD Pipeline Implementation for Microservices on Kubernetes                            
Jan 2024 – Mar 2024 
• Designed and implemented CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Azure DevOps to automate the build, 
test, and deployment processes for microservices-based applications deployed on Kubernetes clusters. 
• Configured automated container builds using Docker and deployed them to Azure Kubernetes Service 
(AKS), ensuring a seamless and scalable container orchestration environment. 
• Utilized Helm charts to manage Kubernetes application configurations and ensure consistent 
deployments across environments. 
• Integrated monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana to track system health, application 
performance, and alerts. 

💠 Cloud Infrastructure Automation with Terraform and Azure                                   
Mar 2024 – May 2024 
• Automated the provisioning of cloud infrastructure on Microsoft Azure using Terraform, enabling 
quick and repeatable deployments of scalable, secure environments. 
• Developed Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates for virtual networks, resource groups, storage 
accounts, and VM instances, optimizing resource allocation and cost efficiency. 
• Implemented automated monitoring and logging systems using Azure Monitor and Log Analytics, 
ensuring high availability and proactive issue resolution. 
• Integrated the infrastructure automation with Jenkins CI/CD pipelines to streamline deployments and 
enhance the speed of environment setup.
